Program Explanation:
    This program will take your level file and transform it into a beautiful graphic board.

    You will need a level (example Level_1.txt) to start playing. The characters are represented by the following symbols:

    & - dwarf
    $ - gift with time
    % - gift destroy all dwarves
    @ - throne
    X - teleport
    M - mage
    K - king
    T - thief
    W - warrior
    * - fire
    F - key
    = - wall
    # - gate
    ! - orc

        You will be able to play the game by controlling one of 4 characters at a time: King, Mage, Warrior and Thief.
        Your goal is to get the King to the throne!
        But be aware, there are orcs, fire traps, walls and gates! But at least they are not moving, unlike the dwarves!
        Don't worry, you will be able to kill trolls with the warrior, the orcs will drop keys for your thief to collect to open the gates,
            the mage is expert in deleting fire traps and the king... well he exists.
        There are teleporters as well, help you to get to places faster.
        There are two types of in the game, one that adds/subtracts time from the level (randomly, do you trust your luck?),
            and one that kills all dwarves in the game, magnificent.

List of files:
    Sources:
        main.cpp
            The main file, creates a GameController object that will control every aspect of the game.

        Window.cpp
            Controls the graphics side of things, displays the window and has a member of the Board class.

        Board.cpp
            Has a 2d Array representing the board the program detects while loading a level.
            Can convert indexes on matrix to pixel on window to place the objects in the right spots in the start of the game.

        Animation.cpp
            Gets spreadsheet of the animation of each object and creates an animation out of it.
            Used when displaying objects on the board.

        Resources.cpp
            A singleton file that stores all the image paths, textures and sprites that the game objects use to draw themselves.

        MainMenu.cpp
            Displays all the menu.

        Menu.cpp
            Handles the all the buttons.

        Buttons.cpp
            Displays a button and handles clicks on it.

        Clock.cpp
            Handles the time left in the game. Has functions to add/subtract time.

        GameObject.cpp
            Base class for all objects of the game, as basic functions like detecting collision with another gameObject etc.

        Moving.cpp
            Derived from the GameObject class, this class is the base class for all moving objects on the board (Player and Dwarf).
            Has some base functions like move and member of the move direction.

        Static.cpp
            Derived from the GameObject class, this class is the base class for all static objects on the board (throne, gate, orc etc)

        Player.cpp
            Derived from the Moving class, this class is the base class for all the players objects (king, mage, warrior and thief)
            Has functions specific for the players like collision with teleporters, throne, keys etc.

        King.cpp, Mage.cpp, Warrior.cpp, Thief.cpp
            Derived from the Player class, these classes is for player objects. 
            Every class has functions specific for it (warrior kills orcs, mage kills fire etc)

        Dwarf.cpp
            Derived from the Moving class, this class is for the dwarves objects on the board.
            Has functions to deal with collisions with the player class.

        Wall.cpp, Gate.cpp, Fire.cpp, Orc.cpp, Key.cpp, Throne.cpp, Gift_1.cpp, Gift_2.cpp, Teleport.cpp
            Derived from the Static class, these classes represents the static objects on the boarad.
            Each has collision behavior according to the game description 
            (orc killed by warrior drops key which can be picked by thief to open gates. Gift_1 adds/subtract time, Gift_2 kills all dwarves etc)


    Include:
        Include files for the cpp files.

        Macro.h
            enums for the objects id used in the Resources file and to search a specific char in the board.

    Resources:
        The objects images, music files and the level files.


Data Structures:

    GameController has vectors of all objects on board.
    Resources has all the textures image paths and sprites.
    Board has vector of strings that stores the loaded level.



Exceptional Algorithms:
    The magnificent double dispatch system.
    and the amazing singleTine Dessign 
    

Known bugs:
